## Introduction 

## Differential Privacy and the Decennial Census 

In August 2018, the US Census Bureau announced it would adopt a new method to protect respondent confidentiality in the 2020 Decennial Census of Population and Housing (Abowd 2018). Instead of using techniques such as cell suppression or household swapping (footnote McKenna's paper), the Bureau will use a technique based on differential privacy to protect confidentiality. ADD IN QUOTE FROM GARFINKEL ABOUT SEA CHANGE IN DATA PUBLICATION.

Why did the Bureau decide to change its disclosure avoidance system? Bureau scientists executed a reconstruction and reidentification attack on the publicly available tabulations from the 2010 decennial census. Using the database reconstruction theorem, the Bureau reconstructed 308,745,538 person records from census tract and block data. 



### Policy Decisions

Disclosure avoidance algorithms require parameters that control the amount of noise, suppression, or swapping applied to the input data. Values for these parameters impact the quality and accuracy of the output data, and it is critical that data users understand both the significance of the parameters and their possible range of values. This section discusses the Top Down Algorithm's parameters and the values used to generate the DDP and the v20200527 datasets. 

#### Global Privacy Loss Budget

The global privacy loss budget ($\epsilon$) controls the trade-off between the privacy afforded to Census respondents and the accuracy of the published data. Values for $\epsilon$ range from 0 to infinity, with 0 representing perfect privacy/no accuracy and infinity representing no privacy/perfect accuracy. After establishing the global PLB, it is then allocated to geographic levels and queries. Geographic levels or queries that receive larger fractions will be more accurate. 

For both the DDP and v20200527 datasets, the Census Bureau's Data Stewardship Executive Policy Committee established a PLB of 4.0 for person-based tables.^[The DDP included housing unit and household data. A PLB of 2.0 was provided housing unit-based queries. The v20200527 only includes person data.] The PLB was then allocated to combinations of geographic levels and queries, and those allocations ultimately control the magnitude of the noise injected into counts.  

#### Geographic Levels

If we think of the cross-tabulations into which noise is injected as a set of rows and columns, the geographic levels define the rows. Each row in a cross-tabulation is a geographic unit within a geographic level (e.g., Autauga County, Alabama, is a geographic unit in the County geographic level). For both the DDP and v20200527 datasets, seven geographic levels in the Census Bureau's hierarchy received direct allocations of the PLB. The nation and state received 20% each, and the remaining five levels (county, census tract group^[The census tract group is not a standard unit in the Census Bureau's geographic hierarchy. It was created specifically for the disclosure avoidance system to control the number of child units for each county], census tract, block group, and block) received 12% each. Geographic levels that receive no direct PLB allocation accumulate accuracy from the units that comprise them.

#### Queries 

If geographic levels define the rows of a cross-tabulation, then queries define the columns. Queries are essentially combinations of demographic variables, and the PLB is allocated to these queries. The disclosure avoidance system defined two types of queries. "Detailed" queries consist of all unique combinations of variables, and "DP" queries are specific combinations of variables. The "detailed" queries allow the Bureau to reconstruct the underlying microdata, and the "DP" queries allow policy makers to target specific statistics that will be more accurate in the published data. 

Queries defined in the disclosure avoidance system do not have a one-to-one relationshiop with tables published in the DDP or v20200527 datasets. The queries are used in the noise injection and optimization processes, and the published tables are created from microdata created by those processes. Categories in the published tables can and will differ from those used in the queries. 

The Census Bureau designed seven and five queries to support the production of person tables in the DDP and v20200527, respectively, and these queries received direct PLB allocations (Table X). Query descriptions and PLB allocations are shown in Table X. The _voting age * Hispanic * race * citizenship_ query, which is used for legislative redistricting, received the largest allocation (50%) in the DDP, and the _total population_ query received the largest allocation (30%) in v20200527. 

#### Invariants and Constraints

Invariants and constraints play key roles in the disclosure avoidance system, particularly in the post-processing routines applied to the noisy counts. Invariants are counts computed directly from the Census Edited File (CEF) and are not subject to noise injection. Constraints control the types and ranges of values in the published statistics. 

The Bureau has not yet selected invariants for the 2020 Decennial Census, but it did set four invariants for the DDP and v20200527 datasets. Total population is invariant at the state-level, and total housing units, total group quarters facilities, and total group quarters facilities by type are invariant at the census block-level. These same four statistics were invariant at the _census block-level_ in the 2010 Decennial Census. Additionally, voting age population and occupied housing units (i.e., households) were invariant at the census block-level in 2010. 

Constraints are the set of rules that the data produced by the disclosure avoidance system must follow. For both datasets we analyzed, constraints included non-negativity, integer, and hierarchical consistency. The non-negativity and integer constraints require that all published statistics to positive integer values. The hierarchical consistency constraint imposes consistency among geographic and category hierarchies. For geographic hierarchies, counts for child units must sum to the counts of their parent unit. For category hierarchies, counts child categories must sum to the counts of their parent category. 

Invariants and constraints are not required by the disclosure avoidance system; instead, they are imposed to satisfy the expectations of policy makers and data users. The state-level total population invariant was established to avoid debates and litigation over Congressional reapportionment. The non-negativity and integer constraints are imposed to avoid negative counts or non-integer values for geographic units, since we only count whole persons in the census. These constraints avoid such illogical values. Consistency constraints guarantee that if you sum the male and female totals from any published data table, you will obtain the same sum.

### Disclosure avoidance system

The disclosure avoidance system that generated the DDP and v20200527 consists of three steps: generating counts from the CEF, injecting noise, and post-processing the satisfy invariants and constraints. The first two steps were the same for both datasets, but the post-processing step differed substantially.

#### Generating Counts

The first step produces counts from the CEF. The disclosure avoidance system consumes the CEF, the queries and geographic levels and creates a set of cross-tabulations (or histograms) - one for each combination of query and geographic level. The cells in each cross-tabulation contain the counts of a particular set of categories (e.g., 0-4 year old males) for a given geographic unit. The number of cells in these cross-tabulations may be massive, particularly at the census block level, and the counts in the cells may be small or even zero.

#### Noise Injection

The second step injects noise into the counts generated in the prior step. These "noisy counts" are, by definition, differentially private, but they may not satisfy invariants or constraints. The noise injection step is implemented with three sub-steps.

##### Compute $\epsilon$ for Each Geographic Level * Query Combination

We compute $\epsilon$ for each combination by multiplying the PLB, geographic level fraction, and query fraction (\#eq:epsilon_equation).

\begin{epsilon_equation}
\epsilon = PLB * GeogLevel_{fraction} * Query_{fraction}
\end{epsilon_equation}

For the DDP and v20200527, the PLB was 4.0, the geographic level fractions are listed in XXXX, and the query fractions are shown in the XXXX column of Table X.

##### Compute the Scale Parameter for the Statistical Distribution
Noise-injection values are generated by randomly drawing a value from a statistical distribution, typically a Laplace distribution for continuous variables or the geometric distribution for discrete variables (i.e., countable values).  





Geographic allocation for demonstration datasets
- add a table with allocations (same for both datasets)
Query allocation for demonstration datasets
- add a table with allocations (different for each dataset)
Scale values and standard deviations 
- add a table with scale (beta) values and standard deviations sqrt(2 beta^2)
